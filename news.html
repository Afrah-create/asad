The three-story structure will accommodate 500 students with modern facilities including study lounges on each floor, spacious bathrooms, and solar-powered hot water systems. The construction is expected to be completed by December 2023, just in time for the new academic year. Headmistress Mrs. Kiconco stated, 'This is part of our vision to provide world-class facilities while maintaining our traditional values.' The project is funded through a combination of school funds, alumni contributions, and a government grant.">Believe it or not, the site is going to be amazing: The Bweranyangi new dormitory construction is one of the extra-ordinary building</a></h2>

The anthem, which took six months to compose, blends traditional Busoga rhythms with contemporary gospel influences. 'We wanted an anthem that reflects our heritage while sounding modern and inspiring,' explained MDD teacher Mr. Walube. The anthem was premiered during the school's 65th anniversary celebrations, performed by a 100-voice choir accompanied by the school band. The lyrics emphasize academic excellence, moral integrity, and service to the community. All students will learn the anthem during weekly MDD lessons, and it will be performed at all major school events. The school has also produced a professional recording available on all major music platforms.">Bweranyangi school Anthem</a></h2>
