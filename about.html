            <h2>School History</h2>
            <p>
                The school traces its origins from Kamukuzi Hill in Mbarara. 
                In 1912, the Church Missionary Society, with eight girl-students housed in a grass-thatched hut,
                 founded the school, then known as Mbarara Junior School.
                The inaugural class included the daughter of the King of Ankole and one of the Ankole prime minister's daughters.
            </p>
            <p>
               The school relocated to Ruharo Hill, also in Mbarara, in 1914, with a student population of 30. There was more land at Ruharo for expansion. 
                This, however, placed the girls' school adjacent to Mbarara High School, a boys' school that had started in 1911.
                 While at Ruharo, the name of the school was changed to Mbarara Girls' Boarding School.
            </p>
            <p>
 In 1954, because of frequent unwelcome visits by students from nearby Mbarara High School and the need for still more expansion,
  the girls' school was again relocated to Bweranyangi Hill in Bushenyi, 55 kilometres (34 mi) to the west.
In the early 1960s, the school was granted permission to start middle school (S1 to S4) and later high school (S5 to S6).
 The primary school was separated from the middle and high school and today exists adjacent to the secondary school as Bweranyangi Primary School, a day and boarding all-girls elementary school.
